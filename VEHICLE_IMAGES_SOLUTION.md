# Vehicle Images - Setup Instructions

## Current Situation
The leasing deals page needs professional vehicle images but external CDN links are not loading reliably.

## Recommended Solution

### Option 1: Upload Your Own Images (BEST)
1. **Collect vehicle images** (you can screenshot from manufacturer websites)
2. **Upload to your server** in a folder like: `/images/vehicles/`
3. **I'll update the data file** to point to: `images/vehicles/honda-accord.jpg`

**Advantages:**
- Complete control
- No external dependencies
- Professional branded images
- Fast loading from your server

### Option 2: Use Stock Image Service
Services like:
- **Pexels.com** - Free stock photos
- **Unsplash.com** - Free high-quality images
- **Pixabay.com** - Free images

**Note:** These may not have every specific model

### Option 3: Manufacturer Press Images
Many manufacturers provide press images:
- Honda: media.honda.com
- Nissan: nissannews.com
- BMW: press.bmwgroup.com
- Audi: audimedia.com

## What I Need From You

To provide the perfect solution, please let me know:

1. **Do you have access to vehicle images?**
   - If yes: I'll show you how to upload and integrate them
   - If no: I'll find another solution

2. **Do you have a preference?**
   - Real photos from manufacturers?
   - Stock automotive photos?
   - Professional studio shots with white backgrounds?

3. **Where can images be hosted?**
   - On your web server?
   - On a CDN service?
   - On a free image host?

## Temporary Solution

For now, I can:
- Keep the layout working without images
- Use a clean icon placeholder
- Or use a generic car silhouette SVG

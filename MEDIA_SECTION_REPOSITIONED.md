## 💡 Why This Is Better

### **Strategic Positioning**
✅ **Natural Credibility Flow**:
- Users see benefits and how it works first
- Then national recognition (TV, podcasts, book)
- Then customer reviews validate the credibility
- Creates powerful 1-2 punch: "Featured on TV" → "Real customer reviews"

### **User Psychology**
✅ **Trust Building Sequence**:
1. **Benefits** → "This sounds good"
2. **Media Features** → "Wow, they're on national TV!"
3. **Google Reviews** → "And real customers love them too!"
4. **Quote Form** → "I'm ready to get a quote!"

### **Conversion Optimization**
✅ **Better Conversion Path**:
- Media features prime users with authority
- Google reviews immediately validate
- Warm leads hit quote form at peak trust
- Maximum credibility right before action
